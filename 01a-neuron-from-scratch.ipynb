    "A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to an arbitrary number of **axes**. What does that mean? A scalar, or a single value, is a 0D tensor. A vector is a 1D tensor. A matrix is a 2D tensor and so on. When a new axis is added we increase the dimension of the tensor. The usage of the word **dimension** can be confusing as it is used to refer to the number of axes as well as the number of elements along an axis. We can eliminate this ambiguity by talking about the **rank** of a tensor as the number of axes it has. Similarly we also refer to the **shape** of the tensor as vector which describes the number of dimensions along each axis of a tensor. The picture below will show you how to think of tensors and their rank visually:"
